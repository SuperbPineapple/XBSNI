# XBSNI
Original Xbox Serial Number Info

This webpage was a project to keep myself busy. I'd recommend using https://xbrev.com/ for actual results.

This tool finds your manufacture date, factory, and an estimated guess of your version.

The legacy version should work on browsers after IE8. It currently has no non-number checking support.

For a working example, visit https://superbpineapple.neocities.org/XBSNI.

Thanks for using!
